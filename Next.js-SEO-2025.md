## What is Next.js SEO and Why It Matters  
Next.js SEO means tailoring your Next.js app to rank higher on search engines like Google. Unlike traditional React apps that render on the client side, Next.js offers server-side rendering and static generation‚Äîboth crucial for fast loading and better crawlability. Optimized SEO increases organic traffic, user engagement, and ultimately conversions.

## Understanding SSR vs. SSG for SEO  

### Server-Side Rendering (SSR)  
- Pages are rendered on the server per request.  
- Ensures search engines get fully rendered HTML instantly.  
- Best for dynamic or frequently updated content.  
- Tradeoff: Slightly slower initial load than static.

### Static Site Generation (SSG)  
- Pages pre-built at build time.  
- Ultra-fast delivery to users and bots.  
- Ideal for blogs, marketing pages, and documentation.  
- Updates require rebuilds but offer great SEO benefits.

Choosing the right rendering strategy impacts crawl efficiency and user experience, both essential SEO factors.

## Optimizing Metadata in Next.js  

### Use `next/head` for Dynamic Meta Tags  
- Add unique `<title>` and `<meta description>` per page.  
- Include primary and related keywords naturally.  
- Keep titles ‚â§ 60 characters, descriptions ‚â§ 155 characters.  
- Enhance click-through rates from search engine results.

### Structured Data and Open Graph Tags  
- Add JSON-LD schema markup for FAQs, articles, breadcrumbs.  
- Include Open Graph tags for better social media sharing.

## Boosting Site Speed and Performance  

### Lazy Loading  
- Load images and components only when visible.  

### Code Splitting  
- Split JavaScript bundles to reduce initial load time.  

### Image Optimization  
- Use Next.js `<Image>` component for automatic resizing & modern formats (WebP).  

### Performance Testing  
- Regularly test using [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) and fix issues.  

Site speed improves user experience and is a confirmed ranking factor.

## Building a Strong Internal Linking Structure
